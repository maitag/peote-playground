# Raycasting "3D" in the style of Wolfenstein 3D

This folder contains a small example of pseudo-3D raycast engine, similar to the old [Wolfenstein 3D game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D).

It consists of

- raycast walls for vertical plane
- perspective distortion for horizontal plane
- billboard sprites with support for wall occlusion

It does not have animated sprites or a proper physics system because I wanted to produce a minimal base on which to expand later.

Many thanks to these articles, which document the techniques and algorithms used...
